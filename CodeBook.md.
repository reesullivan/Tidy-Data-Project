The data was read in with x_test and x_train as the measures collected.
The measures in this data were labled with the values in features.txt

y_test and y_train lable the activity each subject was doing.  
This was translated into descriptions by merging with activity_labels.txt

subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt label which subject.

Both the y data and the subject data were column bound to the x data.

Then only the features.txt columns that contained a mean or standard deviation were kept:
tBodyAcc.mean...X , tBodyAcc.mean...Y , tBodyAcc.mean...Z , tBodyAcc.std...X , 
tBodyAcc.std...Y , tBodyAcc.std...Z , tGravityAcc.mean...X , tGravityAcc.mean...Y ,

angle.Y.gravityMean. , angle.tBodyGyroMean.gravityMean. , angle.Z.gravityMean. , angle.tBodyGyroJerkMean.gravityMean.

The final data was transformed into the following columns:
"Subject" --  the number of the subject tested
"Activity"--  the activity they were doing 
"variable"  -- the measurement of that activity
"mean" -- the mean average of all the type of measure of that activity for that subject
