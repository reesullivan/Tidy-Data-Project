# Tidy-Data-Project
Getting and Cleaning Data Class Project 2

The run_analysis.R will import, modify, and export the data into a tiday data set.

All the components of the data need to be in the working directory. 
Components needed:
X_test.txt
y_test.txt
subject_test.txt
X_train.txt
y_train.txt
subject_train
features.txt
activity_labels.txt

The final output is a text file named tidy_proj.txt, also in the working directory.
